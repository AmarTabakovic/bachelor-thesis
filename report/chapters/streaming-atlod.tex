\chapter{StreamingATLOD}
This chapter describes the implementation of \textit{StreamingATLOD} (\textbf{Streaming-A}ssisted 
\textbf{T}errain \textbf{L}evel \textbf{o}f \textbf{D}etail (Renderer)).

\section{Used Technologies}
StreamingATLOD is written in C++17 and OpenGL 3.3. For compiling build files,
CMake (minimum version 3.5) is used. ATLOD uses the following third-party
libraries:
\begin{itemize}
  \item GLM:
  \item GLEW:
  \item GLFW:
  \item Dear ImGui:
  \item STB:
  \item libwebp:
\end{itemize}


\section{Terrain LOD Algorithm}
The implemented terrain LOD algorithm is based on \textit{Chunked LOD} by Ulrich TODO cite.
Chunked LOD organizes the terrain into a quadtree, where each node represents a section of the terrain with data,
such as heightmap and textures. Chunked LOD and its derived approaches are used in other large-scale terrain rendering systems, such as 
TODO cite.
