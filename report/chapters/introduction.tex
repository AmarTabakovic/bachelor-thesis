\chapter{Introduction}
Terrains are an important part of many practical applications of 3D computer graphics.
They can be found in video games, simulation software and geographical information systems (GIS). 
Terrains are, however, due to their constant visibility and sheer size expensive to render.
Over the last three decades, efficient terrain rendering has been the topic of research
and numerous terrain rendering algorithms and approaches spawned. 

Another important problematic aspect of terrain rendering is the efficient 
and real-time storage, organisation and usage of terrain data. 
In order to support terrains which cannot fit entirely in 
memory, various terrain paging and streaming approaches 
were developed and published over the last few years as well.
