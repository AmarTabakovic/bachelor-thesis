\begin{abstract}
Terrains are an important part of various practical applications of computer graphics, such as
video games, flight simulators and geographical information systems (GIS).
Since terrains are expensive to render, various terrain level of detail (LOD) approaches have been developed
over the last three decades.
Terrain LOD algorithms improve the performance of terrain rendering 
by applying various optimizations, such as rendering distant areas in a lower resolution,
not rendering areas out of view (view-frustum culling), and more.
Besides the rendering performance, another important aspect to terrain rendering is the size of terrain data.
Terrain data too large to fit entirely in memory must be streamed 
from the disk or over the network.

This thesis describes the implementation of a real-time streaming-based terrain LOD system,
which is capable of streaming in data from various providers based on the XYZ map tiling scheme.
The implemented terrain LOD algorithm is based on Chunked LOD by Ulrich TODO cite.
