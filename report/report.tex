\begin{abstract}
Terrains are an important part of various practical applications of computer graphics, such as
video games, flight simulators and geographical information systems.
Since terrains are expensive to render, special rendering optimizations, such as level of detail (LOD).
Besides the rendering performance, another important aspect to terrain rendering is the management of terrain data.
Terrain datasets that are too large to fit entirely in memory must be streamed in
from the disk or over the network and streamed out of memory.

This thesis describes the implementation of StreamingATLOD, a large-scale 
terrain rendering system with LOD
that is capable of rendering the Earth by streaming in 
height data and satellite imagery from web APIs based on the XYZ tiling scheme.
StreamingATLOD is currently built around the data and APIs from the company MapTiler,
which serve height data tiles and satellite imagery tiles. Both layers come 
projected in the Web Mercator projection and are used up to zoom level 14, which corresponds to a precision of 9.5 meters per pixel.

The implemented terrain LOD algorithm is mainly based on Chunked LOD.
The terrain is organized as a quadtree, where 
each quadtree node represents a section of the terrain 
at the resolution of the node's depth.
Each node gets rendered with heightmap-displacement in the vertex shader followed 
by a projection onto the globe. In order to hide cracks between adjacent nodes,
skirts are rendered. The Web Mercator projection cuts off at a latitude of 
$85.05^\circ$, resulting in holes at the North and South Pole. These holes 
get covered with a circular pole mesh.
Terrain sections which are not visible are culled with view-frustum culling 
and horizon culling.

The terrain data is cached 
in a memory cache and a disk cache. Both caches are least-recently used (LRU) caches,
which automatically evict the least-recently used data upon reaching the maximum capacity, 
thus keeping only the most necessary terrain data in memory and on the disk respectively.
New terrain data is streamed in with separate load worker threads,
allowing the render thread to continue rendering while data is loaded 
in the background. The load worker threads load data either from 
the disk cache or from the web API.
Disk cache entries that need to be evicted 
are deleted from the disk using a separate disk deallocation thread.

StreamingATLOD's rendering and streaming performance were benchmarked 
on a 2020 Intel MacBook Air with the disk caching disabled. StreamingATLOD yielded 
on average around 60 frames per second and was able to load 
the data required for rendering at a reasonable speed.

Some technical aspects in which StreamingATLOD could be improved are 
prioritized loading of terrain data, better high precision support
and rendering transitions between LOD level changes.
Possible extensions and future work include incorporating 
a realistic atmosphere, supporting multiple tile layers and
extending StreamingATLOD into a software development kit.

\section*{Personal Motivation}
Why terrain rendering? It all started during the 
fourth semester of my studies, 
where I had to choose a topic for 
the preceeding project course ``Project 2''. 
I saw in the list of project proposals that 
terrain level of detail was one 
of the offered topics and after a first quick research
on the topic, I was hooked immediately, not
only because I found terrain rendering interesting and visually stunning, 
but mainly because I had the opportunity to challenge myself
with a (subjectively) difficult topic.
As part of the preceeding project, I implemented a small terrain  
renderer with LOD which worked decently and served 
as a good base for further work and exploration.
But I wanted to render the probably most extreme 
and well-known example of a terrain there is: 
the entire Earth.
This of course meant tackling entirely new challenges,
such as geographic projections,
multithreading, streaming and caching of terrain data,
but this is exactly what made this project more exciting.
In the end, the opportunity of working a project like this 
does not come every day.

\section*{Acknowledegments}
I would like to thank Prof. Marcus Hudritsch 
for the opportunity to write this thesis
and for our the pleasant cooperation.
I always enjoyed our weekly meetings
and your support. I would also 
like to thank Dr. Eric Dubuis 
for supervising this thesis and for 
his crucial inputs during our intermediate meeting.
Also thanks to Marino for joining the weekly meetings 
towards the end of the thesis.

I would finally like to thank my family and my 
girlfriend Cristina for supporting me throughout 
my studies.
